I was smoking a cigarette;\nMaud, my wife, and the tenor, McKey,\nWere singing together a blithe duet,\nAnd days it were better I should forget\nCame suddenly back to me,—\nDays when life seemed a gay masque ball,\nAnd to love and be loved was the sum of it all.\n\nAs they sang together, the whole scene fled,\nThe room's rich hangings, the sweet home air,\nStately Maud, with her proud blond head,\nAnd I seemed to see in her place instead\nA wealth of blue-black hair,\nAnd a face, ah! your face—yours, Lisette;\nA face it were wiser I should forget.\n\nWe were back—well, no matter when or where;\nBut you remember, I know, Lisette.\nI saw you, dainty and debonair,\nWith the very same look that you used to wear\nIn the days I should forget.\nAnd your lips, as red as the vintage we quaffed,\nWere pearl-edged bumpers of wine when you laughed.\n\nTwo small slippers with big rosettes\nPeeped out under your kilt-skirt there,\nWhile we sat smoking our cigarettes\n(Oh, I shall be dust when my heart forgets!)\nAnd singing that self-same air:\nAnd between the verses, for interlude,\nI kissed your throat and your shoulders nude.\n\nYou were so full of a subtle fire,\nYou were so warm and so sweet, Lisette;\nYou were everything men admire;\nAnd there were no fetters to make us tire,\nFor you were—a pretty grisette.\nBut you loved as only such natures can,\nWith a love that makes heaven or hell for a man.\n\n\nThey have ceased singing that old duet,\nStately Maud and the tenor, McKey.\n\"You are burning your coat with your cigarette,\nAnd qu'avez vous, dearest, your lids are wet,\"\nMaud says, as she leans o'er me.\nAnd I smile, and lie to her, husband-wise,\n\"Oh, it is nothing but smoke in my eyes.\"
